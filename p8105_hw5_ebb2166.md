```

## Problem 1

#### Step 1: Read in, describe, and prepare data

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest" ~ "solved"
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

This Washington Post dataset includes information on homicides between
the years 2007 and 2017 in major U.S. city: recording the name, age, and
race of the victim as well as geocoordinates for where the homicide took
place. Each case is categorized by whether an arrest was made, and
whether the case was closed: exploring patterns of unsolved homicides in
urban areas nationally.

#### Step 2: Compute total and unsolved homicides

For each city, want to count number of unsolved homicides, and then
number of total homicides so can compute proportion unsolved.

``` r
aggregate_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

#### Step 3: Trial prop test for single city

``` r
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved),
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative
    ##      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>      
    ## 1    0.646      239. 6.46e-54         1    0.628     0.663 1-sample… two.sided

#### Step 4: Iterate prop test

``` r
results_df = 
  aggregate_df %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>% 
  select(-prop_tests) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high) %>% 
  arrange(desc(estimate))
```

#### Step 5: Make a plot

``` r
results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) + 
  labs(
    title = "Proportion of unsolved murders with 95% CIs",
    x = "City",
    y = "Estimate proportion of unsolved murders"
  )
```

The cities with the highest proportion of unsolved homicides are
Chicago, New Orleans, and Baltimore. Having worked for 4 years as an
emergency physician in the only trauma center hospital serving New
Orleans, this finding unfortunately does not surprise me…

## Problem 2

#### Step 1: Read in data

First trial reading in path.

``` r
path_df = 
  tibble(
    path = list.files("lda_data")
  ) %>% 
  mutate(path = str_c("lda_data/", path))

read_csv(path_df$path[[1]])
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   week_1 = col_double(),
    ##   week_2 = col_double(),
    ##   week_3 = col_double(),
    ##   week_4 = col_double(),
    ##   week_5 = col_double(),
    ##   week_6 = col_double(),
    ##   week_7 = col_double(),
    ##   week_8 = col_double()
    ## )

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   week_1 week_2 week_3 week_4 week_5 week_6 week_7 week_8
    ##    <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>
    ## 1    0.2  -1.31   0.66   1.96   0.23   1.09   0.05   1.94

Next trial a `for` loop.

Want column for each df for each participant next to path for that
participant.

Then mutate to get study arm, pivot to make table longer.
